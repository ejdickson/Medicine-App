# Medicine App
Project 3: A medicine tracking app to help multiple users keep track of their medicines, alert when they need refills, and keep track of which pharamacy they prefer.

Created using the MERN stack for Project 3 of Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. Inspired by a need to track a family member's many different medicines from many different doctors.
